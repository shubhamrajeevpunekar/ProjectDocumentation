* Project Description
Knowing the emotional state of an individual can be crucial in determining what action is to  be taken as a response. Recognizing the affective state of a human can be difficult for humans as well as computer systems. Many features can be considered such as voice samples, facial cues or even text written by the person to identify the emotional state of the individual. \\
The major focus of the project is improving human-machine interaction using the NAO robot. The robot will accept the input from the person periodically in the form of speech samples, comprising of voice and text as well as facial cues and will interpret the current emotional state of the person. Although our main focus is on humanizing the NAO robot and making it an ideal companion for old people, there are myriad of other uses that can be achieved; some of which are: development of an affect-aware city, Add security layer at public venues to detect malicious intent and deal with hostage situation effectively, measure response and ratings in focus groups (consumer response to commercials etc), wearables that help autistics discern emotion etc.
* Literature Survey
1. /Jeong-Sik Park,  Gil-Jin Jang/ ”Implementation of Voice emotion Recognition for Interaction with Mobile Agent , ACM 2014”
   The paper proposes a simple smartphone interface framework which consists of detection of human voice, extraction of emotional features and identification of an emotional state. Energy based approach for detection of human voice is selected in which if continues estimates of spectral energy of consecutive frames exceeds a pre-determined threshold, the region is regarded as starting point of voice signal. The pitch, log-energy, and “Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC)” are selected for extraction of emotional features which make a feature vector sequence. Acoustic features vectors extracted are analyzed and compared with patterns for each emotion type. Guassian Mixture Model is the classification algorithm used. This approach achieved 70.1% correctness within 1s response time. The future work suggested is applying proposed concepts for human-machine interaction in personal agent applications.
2. /Yu Gu, Eric Postma, Hai-Xing Lin/ ”Vocal Emotion Recognition using Log-Gabor Filters , ACM 2015”
   The propsed work utilizes 2d Gabor filters in order to decompose the associated spectogram in order to perform a spectro-temporal analysis of affective vocalizations. Instead of including all potentially relevant features which leads of dimensionality problem and subsequent degradation of performance, the work uses “feature learning” in which relevant features are automatically obtained from raw speech signals. However this leads to considerable computational resouces. Hence, no. of features is kept to minimum. By performing analysis on local specto-temporal structure, the spectrogram is treated as an image and standard image processing is implemented. Comparative evaluation of MFCC and LPCC features, untuned and tuned Gabor filters and all above combinations is done. SVM is used as a classifier. The confusion matrix for performance using tuned Gabor Filters provide a maximum of 91.6% accuracy whereas a combination of acoustic features and Gabor filter provides 93.5% accuracy.
3. /Gloria Zen, Elisa Ricci, Nicu Sebe/  “Unsupervised Domain Adaption for Personalized Facial Emotion Recognition, ACM 2014”
   A personalization approach is proposed in which only unlabeled target-specific data are required. A new method to represent the source sample distribution based on only Support Vectors of source classifiers is proposed. Regression framework is used to learn a mapping between a marginal distribution of the data points associated to a given person and the parameters of his/her personalized classifier which is represented by a set of Support Vectors of linear classifier in the source case and by all unlabeled data points in the target case.
4. /Ahmed Mustafa Mahmoud,  Wan Haslina Hassan/ ”Determinism in Speech Pitch Relation to Emotions, ICIS 2009”
   A deterministic rule-based text-to-speech emotional synthesis approach is proposed to generate emotional speech using semitonic interval-driven rules. Emotional speech samples are analyzed and intervals are extracted using praat tool. Objective evaluation compares sysnthesized voice to natural voice and calculates difference as an error function by considering mean square error as a measure of similarity. New emotional states may be defined using same proposed approach. Algorithms that integrate two or more emotional states may be combined to generate a variety of complex emotions.
5. /Nancy Semwal,  Abhijeet Kumar, Sakthivel Narayanan/  “Automatic Speech Emotion Detection using Multi-Domain Acoustic Feature Selection and Classification,  IEEE 2015”
   The proposed approach concentrated on determining emotions from speech signals. Various acoustic features such as energy, zero-crossing rate(ZCR), fundamental frequency, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient are extractedfor short term, overlapping frames derived from the input signal. A feature vector for every utterance is then constructed by analyzing mean, median, etc. over all frames. Sequential Backward Selection is used with K-fold cross validation to select a subset of useful features. Detection of emotions is done by classifying respective features from the full candidate feature vectors into classes, using either a pre-trained SVM or a Linear Discriminant Analysis classifier. Accuracy of 80% was obtained when tested on EmoDB dataset.
6. /Lei Pang,  Chong-Wah Ngo/  “Multimodal Learning with Deep Boltzmann Machine for Emotion Prediction,  ACM 2015”
   In contrast to existing works which concentrate on either Audio, text or video, a joint density model is proposed over the space of multi-modal inputswith Deep Boltzmann Machine. The model is trained directly on user-generated Web videos without any labelling effort. Multiple layers of hidden units and multiple modalities make learning difficult, hence learning is split into 2 stages. First, each RBM component is pre trained using greedy layerwise strategy. Then, learnt parameters are used to initialize the parameters of all layers in DBM and then the multimodal DBM is trained to finetune different modalities in a unified way. A major factor is that the deep architecture enlightens the possibility of discovering highly non-linear relationships between low-level features across different modalities. A performance improvement of 7.7% in classification accuracy is observed.
7. /Sun Jie,  Daniel Peng Zhuo,  Li Qinpei,  Wong Chern Yuen, Anthony, Rui Yan/  “Emotion Recognition and Expression in Therapeutic Social Robot Design“
   The focus of the work is to enable a therapeutic social robot to understand human emotions and express emotion through gestures accordingly. To identify human emotion, tactile sensors were utilized and installed on the robot’s head to detect user’s touch signals and classify them into four patterns( hit, pat, stroke, unknown ). Classification task was performed based on three methods viz. Localist Attractor Network, Temporal Decision Tree and Naïve Bayes Classifier. The parameters from classification are determined by 5-fold cross-validation using 50 datasets under each pattern. All the three methods canachieve more than 90% accuracy. According to the classification of the type of touch, emotional states such as unhappiness, love, relaxation and confusion are determined.
8. /Benjamin Guthier,  Rajwa Alharthi,  Rana Abaalkhail,  Abdulmotaleb El Saddik/ “Detection and Visualization of Emotions in an Affect-Aware City,  ACM”
   In the proposed work, emotions are represented as four-dimensional vectors of pleasantness, arousal, dominance and unpredictability. In the training phase, emotion word hashtags in the messages are used as the ground-truth emotion contained in a message. A neural network is trained by using the presence of words, hashtags and emoticons in the message as features. During the live phase, these features are extracted from geo-tagged Twitter messages and given as input to neural-network. The detected emotions are aggregated over space and time and visualized on a map of the city.

* Literature Gap
In general literature available today, numerous features have been developed, however the performance of classifiers is still limited, which is because of the fact that emotional states cannot be accurately distinguished by a well-defined set of discriminating features. Also, majority of work done  towards emotion detection is focused on a single mode i.e. audio/ text/ video. There is limited practical work done with multimodal inputs.

* Project Scope
NAO robot will automatically and periodically analyze voice samples and facial cues in order to detect the emotional state of the person interacting with the robot. Depending on the emotions the person is feeling, the NAO robot will give an appropriate response. The response will be a combination of vocal response as well as physical gesture. This humane response will make the robot an ideal companion for old people. The robot will not be able to detect every single complex emotion, but will be limited to a subset of generalized emotions.
